## [HTML/CSS](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/HTML-CSS)

> **HTML** is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. **CSS** is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. This module will introduce the basic concepts of HTML5 and CSS. We spend time getting you familiar with your text editor and handy developer tools. After this we will focus on responsive web development. Making responsive websites is an important part of front-end programming. You will learn how to make your websites responsive by using media queries using a “mobile first” approach. Last but not least we will spend time practicing some soft skills that we think are important for becoming a good developer. These include: give and receive feedback to your fellow students, presenting and explaining your work.

**Module goals**

- Basic understanding of HTML5 and CSS (DOM, semantic elements)
- Know how to organize your files
- Know your way around your text editor
- Feel comfortable working with the console
- Properly indent your code
- Properly naming classes, id's
- Responsive mobile first development
- Know "good" and "bad" practices when it comes to HTML
- Get an understanding of what good resources are on the web
- Give receive/feedback from/on fellow students
- Presenting and explaining your work to others

## [GIT](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/Git) + [CLI](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/CommandLine)

> **GIT** is a software for tracking changes in any set of files. It's usually used for coordinating work among developers collaboratively working on the same source code during software development. The **command line** (CLI, shell) is the interface between you (the user) and the operating system which interprets your commands and allows the computer to respond to your command. In this module students get familiar with the command line and learn what GIT is and what problem it solves.

**Module goals**

**GIT:**

- Have an understanding of what GIT is and what problem it solves.
- Understand what a `commit` is and how it represents a certain unit of work
- Know how to create a new repository using `clone` and `init`
- Know how to add / remove files to that new repository
- Know how to `commit` and `push` files in that new repository.
- Have an understanding of branches and how they can be used.
- Know how to navigate between branches and what git commands to use for them.

**CLI:**

- To know the terminal/bash/command line for UNIX based systems.
- Navigate the file system without using a UI explorer.
- Copy, rename and move files with terminal commands.
- Learn output redirection, piping on the terminal.
- Write basic shell scripts to ease the programming life.

## [JavaScript1](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/JavaScript/tree/main/javascript1)

## [JavaScript3](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/JavaScript/tree/main/javascript3)

**Module goals**

- (re)writing data structures (in JSON)
- Map, reduce filter
- Closures
- Promises
- Test Driven Development

## [Database](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/databases)

> What is a **database**? A place to store “things”. Could be as simple as a phone book (physical) or as complex as storing all the inventory for Amazon.com. Why use databases? Easier than having data all over the place. Puts the problem of collecting, storing, sorting and searching data in a single place. There are two primary types of database systems - relational and NoSQL. Relational databases have tables that relate to one another and can be “joined” ACID vs BASE

**Module goals**
By the end of this module, students should have a familiarity with and basic understanding of the following:

- Entities
- The relational model
- The Structured Query Language (SQL)
- The construction of a database system
- MySQL as an example of a relational database system
- Non-relational data and NoSQL
- MongoDB as an example of a NoSQL database

## [NODE.js](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/Node.js)

> Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine).For almost any web application, it is essential to have a backend. The backend is a place where we, the developers, can store our data, communicate with users and let the users communicate with us, do smart things like calculations, data processing etc.

There are many languages for this. We might've heard of Java, C, C++, Go, Python, Ruby, PHP and many more.

There are two reasons why we at HYF choose Node.JS over others:

1. You already know JavaScript, so it's easier to get started than other languages
2. Node.js is great for making web APIs because it is asynchronous by nature and thus allows for high input/output. By this we mean that it allows many users to make very light requests at the same time.

## What will we learn?

- What is Node.js?
- Using Node Package Manager (NPM)
- Using `require` to include modules
- Using `http` to handle http requests and respond
- Using `fs` to read from and write to files.
- Using `process` to read arguments from the CLI
- Using `express` to make a RESTful API

## [React](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/React)

The React Module is split into 2 modules

### [React 1](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/React/tree/main/react1)

By the end of this module, students should have a familiarity with and basic understanding of the following:

- React Components
- State and Lifecycle
- Forms and Managing State
- API Integration

### [React 2](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/React/tree/main/react2)

**Module goals**

By the end of this module, students should have a familiarity with and basic understanding of the following:

- SPA and routing using React Router
- Redux

## [Individual Project](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/meal-sharing-template/)

**Module goals**

By the end of this module, students should have able to use all the acumulated knowlegde and skills and deploy on Heroku the Meal Sharing App that should be developed using React on the Frontend, NodeJS and KnexJS for the Backend and MySQL for Databases.

## [Final Project](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Project)

> In this module students work together in a team on a predefined project. The goal of this module is to combine all your acquired skills from the last modules into a project, often in collaboration with a real-world organisation and real-world challenge to solve. In this project, scoping, requirement analysis and project management are core themes while building your first full-stack project! 💪

**Module goals**

- Working on a full-stack skeleton (provided by us), using different technologies you’ve been exposed to during the HackYourFuture program.
- Fill the gaps that you have left in the previous modules. Did you miss an Node assignment? Make sure to pick up an extra issue there.
- Show that you can work and function in a team.
- Get familiar working with Scrum.

**After this module we offer (technical)interview and cv training for those who are interested. The goal of these sessions are to:**

- Get your CV and LinkedIn ready for when you are starting to go to interviews.
- Get an understanding of how (technical) interviews go in the Danish job market.
