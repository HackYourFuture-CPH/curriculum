>Here you can find an overview of the HackYourFuture program. It gives insight in how our program is structured, organized, what you can expect from the modules that we teach and last but not least where we teach and where you can find support during the week. 
Our half-year course is divided into modules that last 3-5 weeks with exception of the project module that lasts 6 weeks.


## How do we teach?

### Modules
At HackYourFuture we teach in modules. The modules can be seen as a 3-5 week [sprint](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Scrum-sprint) wherein the teachers set clear learning goals for the end of each module. The list of module goals should be used by students to check if they understood all the core concepts of a certain module. 

### What do we mean by module goals?
Module goals can be read as: "by the end of this module, students should have a familiarity with and basic understanding of the following"

### Come prepared!
Students are expected to finish all reading material before class, teachers provide students with reading material (mostly on Wednesdays) introducing the concepts that will be discussed in the upcoming session. Students are expected to __always__ come prepared to the class on Sunday.

### Online support
During the week students work at home on the given assignments or reading material provided by the teacher. Teachers and mentors are available during the week on Slack to provide support and or answer questions related to the given homework.

## What tools do we use?

### Github
Our **[Github repository](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH)** contains all the specifications and learning goals for the different modules. It's advised to get yourself familiar with [Github](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/). How to actually work with Git, a version control system, will be covered during the JavaScript modules. If students did not follow these modules yet they at least should be able to navigate and find course material inside our Github repository.

### Slack
**[Slack](https://slack.com/is)** is used to communicate between teachers and students during the week. Each class has their own channel in Slack where module specific questions can be asked. We require our students to be active on Slack and ask questions when they get stuck. Students are off course also stimulated to help each other out.
